Project Overview: 
This Power BI project was developed to assist AtliQ Hardware, a fictional computer hardware supplier, in identifying key sales trends and overcoming declining revenue. By leveraging Power BIâ€™s data visualization capabilities, the project provides actionable insights that enable data-driven decisions for business growth.

Project Goals: 
Diagnose the causes behind declining sales trends.
Visualize sales performance across time and product categories.
Deliver a dynamic dashboard that supports real-time data exploration and decision-making.
Approach

1. Data Setup & Exploration
Server Configuration & Data Import:
Set up a MySQL server and imported sales data for analysis.
SQL Queries for Insight Discovery:
Ran key SQL queries to analyze data integrity and structure, uncovering:
ðŸš© Negative values in the transactions table that required resolution.
ðŸ’± Dual currency transactions (INR and USD) to be standardized into INR.

3. Data Integration with Power BI
ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load):
Connected MySQL directly to Power BI, ensuring a smooth data import pipeline.
Data Transformation Highlights:
Cleared blank entries to maintain data cleanliness.
Removed negative sales values after validation in MySQL.
Standardized currency by converting USD to INR using a custom column.
Applied all transformations seamlessly using Power BI's Close & Apply feature.

4. Data Analysis & Visualization Preparation
Used inner joins to link transactions with date data, providing time-based revenue insights.
Calculated annual and total revenue, establishing a robust foundation for visual storytelling.


Key Insights
Identified inconsistencies in transaction data, including negative values and dual currencies, and resolved them for accurate reporting.
Established a clean, integrated dataset ready for dynamic, interactive visualizations in Power BI.
